            <p id="abstract">When banks choose similar investment strategies the financial system becomes vulnerable to common shocks. We model a simple financial system in which banks decide about their investment strategy based on a private belief about the state of the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of peers. Observing a larger group of peers conveys more information and thus leads to a stronger social belief. Extending the standard model of Bayesian updating in social networks, we show that the probability that banks synchronize their investment strategy on a state non-matching action critically depends on the weighting between private and social belief. This effect is alleviated when banks choose their peers endogenously in a network formation process, internalizing the externalities arising from social learning.</p>

Banks optimize a portfolio of risky investments and riskless excess reserves according to their risk, return, and liquidity preferences. They are linked via interbank loans and face stochastic deposit supply. Evidence is provided that the central bank stabilizes interbank markets in the short-run only. Comparing different interbank network structures, it is shown that money-center networks are more stable than random networks. Systemic risk via contagion is compared to common shocks and it is shown that both forms of systemic risk require diﬀerent optimal policy responses.</p>

          <p id="abstract">We provide a novel explanation for the fragility of liquidity in certain repo and collateral markets. These markets are linked due to a destabilizing spiral between market and funding liquidity. We study how the over-the-counter nature of many repo and collateral markets affects such illiquidity spirals. In particular, we model liquidity provided by intermediaries (banks) as the equilibrium outcome of a static game on two directed networks representing the OTC repo and collateral markets. We show that for a large set of different OTC market structures, there exists an illiquidity spiral such that additional banks withdraw from the markets after an initial exogenous shock renders some banks unable to trade. Furthermore, for certain market structures, we find that liquidity may evaporate abruptly following an exogenous shock. Finally, when one of the two markets is replaced by a centralized exchange, post-shock liquidity is always greater than in the full OTC case.

          <p id="abstract">Co-authorship is a form of formal intellectual collaboration in academia and is well researched. But most intellectual collaboration among academics, for example the provision of helpful commentary on a colleague's manuscript, is informal and not well understood. In this paper, we study social network effects in informal intellectual collaboration in financial economics. We reconstruct the social network of financial economics from formal and informal collaboration among financial economists using a novel and unique hand-collected dataset based on all publications in six leading journals in financial economics from 1997-2011. Our hypothesis is that informally collaborating with a colleague who is more central in the social network of financial economics improves the scientific impact of a research article. Treating the assignment of discussants at NBER summer institutes as quasi-natural experiment, we show that an increase in the discussant's eigenvector centrality by about 12.5% from the mean is associated with 2% more citations for an average research article.</p>

          <p id="abstract">We examine the effect of ex-post information contagion on the ex-ante level of systemic risk defined as the probability of joint default of banks. Because of counterparty risk or common exposures, bad news about one bank reveals valuable information about another bank and trigger information contagion. When banks are subject to common exposures, information contagion induces small adjustments to bank portfolios and therefore increases systemic risk overall. When banks are subject to counterparty risk, by contrast, information contagion induces a large shift toward more prudential portfolios and therefore reduces systemic risk.</p>

          <p id="abstract">This paper explores the economics of interbank lending and borrowing using bank-balance sheet data for Germany, the largest European economy. Our 2002-2014 panel data set allows us to analyze the cross section and the dynamics of the observed interbank exposures. Our findings suggest a genuine intermediation process within the banking system, with implications for allocative efficiency and financial stability. A typical bank in our sample holds a significant amount of term and overnight interbank positions on both sides of the balance sheet simultaneously, and at any point in time. The average contract length in the German interbank market is well above one year, which stands in contrast to the widely held view that interbank exposures are largely overnight. Based on panel regressions, we find the build-up of the interbank book to be driven by innovations in the client book (i.e. non-bank deposit taking and lending). The resulting interbank book affects the bank’s duration gap, the maturity disparity between bank assets and bank liabilities. A bank’s duration gap is often seen as its major macroeconomic risk factor. Overall our findings lend support to a theory of banking that involves leverage stacks, i.e intermediation among banks.</p>

We study liquidity reallocation in this interbank network using a novel dataset of all interbank loans settled between European banks. We show the existence of a network pricing channel in over-the-counter markets: a bank's importance in the interbank network, measured by its centrality, has an economically significant effect on its liquidity provision and access. The effect is stronger for the price of liquidity than for the volume, and stronger for liquidity provision than for liquidity access.</p>

          <p id="abstract">In academia, informal collaboration is an integral element in the production of knowledge. We construct the social network of informal collaboration using acknowledgments of 2782 scholarly articles published in six journals in financial economics. We rank financial economists according to their centrality in the social network of informal collaboration and find that central commenters are not necessarily the most central or the most productive authors. We explore the determinants of high centrality rankings using detailed CV data for the most central academics. A PhD from a better ranked department is associated with a better centrality ranking. Seniority is associated with worse rankings, albeit at a decreasing rate.</p>

            <p id="abstract">This paper analyses the network structure of the South African overnight interbank market by employing measures from network theory. A unique data set of interbank transactions from the South African Multiple Options Settlement (SAMOS) system is used. It is shown that the South African interbank system has been largely stable and resilient over the period from March 2005 to June 2010, even in times of great distress on the international financial markets. The number of banks participating in the interbank market was approximately constant over the analysed period, as well as the high level of interconnectedness. A low average path length and high clustering coefficient indicate a high level of liquidity allocation and risk sharing in the system. Furthermore a Network Systemic Importance Index (NSII) is developed to assess the systemic importance of individual banks in South Africa. This index measures each banks size, interconnectedness and substitutability by employing network theory. It is a relative index in the sense that the systemic importance of any given bank does not only depend on the properties of the bank itself, but rather on the properties of the whole network. This approach is therefore less prone to moral hazard and can be used as a tool for macroprudential oversight in addition to microprudential supervision. The NSII addresses the cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk. It has to be stressed, however, that it gives no indication of the default probability of individual banks and has therefore be accompanied by other macroprudential tools for a full picture of systemic risk.</p>

            <p id="abstract">One of the most pressing questions in the aftermath of the financial crisis is how to deal with systemically important financial institutions
            (SIFIs). The purpose of this paper is to review the recent literature on systemic risk and evaluate the regulation proposals in the Basel III framework with respect to this literature. A number of shortcomings in the current framework are analyzed and three measures for future reform are proposed: counter-cyclical risk-weights, dynamic asset value correlation multipliers, and enhanced transparency requirements for SIFIs.</p>
